Dancer::Middleware::DetectMobileBrowser

This Dancer plack middleware detects mobile browsers and optionally redirects.  The regex used is straight
from http://detectmobilebrowser.com/.  Thanks to Chad Smith for all his hard work.

To install make the following directories under APPLICATION/lib

Dancer/Middleware

Copy DetectMobileBrowser.pm to APPLICATION/lib/Dancer/Middleware

In your dancer apps config.yaml add the following lines, note the redirect_to and the line following is optional.

plack_middlewares:
  -
    - "+Dancer::Middleware::SmartPhoneDetection"
    - redirect_to
    - "http://mobile.quispiam.com"


DetectMobileBrowser sets an environment variable MOBILE_BROWSER.  This variable can be used in your routes thusly

get '/' => sub {
	if(request->env->{ MOBILE_BROWSER }) {
		debug('Smart phone yeah !');
	} else {
		debug('Boring standard browser yeah !');
	}	
};

Or if the redirect_to variable is set the request will be redirected if the browser is detected to be a mobile browser.
